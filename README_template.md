# Analysis & Visualization Snakemake Workflow Using/Powered by PACKAGE for DATA/MODALITY
A [Snakemake 8](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) workflow for performing and visualizing analyses of data (e.g., ...) powered by the package [package](https://www.packageURL.org).

> [!NOTE]  
> This workflow adheres to the module specifications of [MR.PARETO](https://github.com/epigen/mr.pareto), an effort to augment research by modularizing (biomedical) data science. For more details, instructions, and modules check out the project's repository.

# üíø Software
This project is designed to run on top of the [Snakemake workflow management system](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and has been tested against the Snakemake version listed in the table below. In addition this project depends on, and is made possible by, the following Software:

| Software | Reference (DOI) |
| :---: | :---: |
| Snakemake | https://doi.org/10.12688/f1000research.29032.2 |
| packageA | https://doi.org/10.AAA/ |
| packageB | https://doi.org/10.BBBB/ |


# üî¨ Methods
This is a template for the Methods section of a scientific publication and is intended to serve as a starting point. Only retain paragraphs relevant to your analysis. References [ref] to the respective publications are curated in the software table above. Versions (ver) have to be read out from the respective conda environment specifications (`workflow/envs/*.yaml file`) or post-execution in the result directory (`{module}/envs/*.yaml`). Parameters that have to be adapted depending on the data or workflow configurations are denoted in squared brackets e.g., [X].

# üìö Resources
- Recommended compatible [MR.PARETO Modules](https://github.com/epigen/mr.pareto/#-modules) for up-/downstream analyses:
  - [Unsupervised Analysis](https://github.com/epigen/unsupervised_analysis) to understand and visualize similarities and variations between cells/samples, including dimensionality reduction and cluster analysis. Useful for all tabular data including single-cell and bulk sequencing data.
  - [<ins>Sp</ins>lit, F<ins>ilter</ins>, Norma<ins>lize</ins> and <ins>Integrate</ins> Sequencing Data](https://github.com/epigen/spilterlize_integrate/) after count quantification.
  - [Differential Analysis with limma](https://github.com/epigen/dea_limma) to identify and visualize statistically significantly different features (e.g., genes or genomic regions) between sample groups.
  - [Enrichment Analysis](https://github.com/epigen/enrichment_analysis) for biomedical interpretation of (differential) analysis results using prior knowledge.
  - [Genome Browser Track Visualization](https://github.com/epigen/genome_tracks/) for quality control and visual inspection/analysis of genomic regions/genes of interest or top hits.
  - [ATAC-seq Processing](https://github.com/epigen/atacseq_pipeline) to quantify chromatin accessibility.
  - [scRNA-seq Data Processing & Visualization](https://github.com/epigen/scrnaseq_processing_seurat) for processing (multimodal) single-cell transcriptome data.
  - [Differential Analysis using Seurat](https://github.com/epigen/dea_seurat) to identify and visualize statistically significantly different features (e.g., genes or proteins) between groups.
  - [Perturbation Analysis using Mixscape from Seurat](https://github.com/epigen/mixscape_seurat) to identify perturbed cells from pooled (multimodal) CRISPR screens with sc/snRNA-seq read-out (scCRISPR-seq).
